Profiler was designed and developed as part of a forensics methodology which involves executing the same malware specimen multiple times in differently configured systems, in order to observe and record possible diverse behavioral patterns that most modern contextually dependent malware instances exhibit.
Profiler is meant to extend the functionality of the Cuckoo sandbox malware analysis tool in order to automate the process of correlating and investigating multiple analyses results of the same malware sample. Profiler is able to automatically detect differences and similarities in the malwareâ€™s activities among its multiple executions, thus identifying any contingent behavioral changes.
